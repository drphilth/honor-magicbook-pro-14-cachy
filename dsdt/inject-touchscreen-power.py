# Touchscreen power fix, modeled on the FIRMWARE'S OWN pattern for the sibling I2C4/I2C5
# panels (PowerResource PTPL in SSDT7) that the OEM "forgot" to add to the active I2C2
# FTSC1000 node. Adds a self-contained PowerResource (PWRR) whose _ON drives power (GPIO
# 108, desc 0x0014040C) + reset (GPIO 130, 0x00140482) via SPMV(mode)+SGOV(value), referenced
# by _PR0 AND _PR3 methods (gated on the device _STA, like the firmware). Linux turns the
# resource _ON when it powers the device to D0 at i2c_hid probe (verified path:
# i2c_device_probe -> dev_pm_domain_attach(POWER_ON) -> acpi_dev_pm_full_power ->
# acpi_device_set_power(D0) -> PWRR._ON). NO _PSC (see block note). Targets ONLY the FTSC1000.
